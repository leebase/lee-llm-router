## Architecture Principles

1. **Tiny First** — smallest viable implementation
2. **Explicit State** — no hidden behavior
3. **Human Authority** — autonomy with oversight
4. **Audit Everything** — reproducible history
5. **Artifacts Over Chat** — durable outputs

## Core Components

### Data Stores
- `context.md` — session working memory
- `result-review.md` — running log of completed work
- `sprint-plan.md` — tactical execution plan
- `product-definition.md` — vision and constraints
