# Lee LLM Router Backlog Item Schema

> **The Contract**: AI (scout) → Human (curator) → Builder (factory)

This schema defines the YAML frontmatter format for all backlog items. It unifies:
- Sprint-plan operational focus
- Research mining detail (risks, mitigations, effort)
- Factory consumption requirements

---

## File Location

```
backlog/
├── candidates/       # AI writes here (read-only for AI after write)
├── approved/         # Human moves items here when approved
├── parked/           # Human moves items here (deferred, needs more info)
├── implemented/      # Builder moves items here when complete
└── schema.md         # This file
```

**File naming**: `backlog/{candidates,approved,parked,implemented}/BI-NNN-{kebab-title}.md`

## Schema Definition

```yaml
---
# REQUIRED: Identity
id: BI-001                          # Backlog Item ID (BI-NNN)
title: Example Feature              # Human-readable title

# REQUIRED: Source
source: research/primitive          # Which work inspired this
source_insight: >                   # One sentence insight
  Key insight from research goes here.

# REQUIRED: Rationale (why this matters)
opportunity: >                      # What capability is gained
  Describe what the project gains if this is implemented.

why_now: >                          # Tie to current phase/mission
  Why this matters now. Connect to current phase or blockers.

# REQUIRED: Implementation (what to build)
minimal_impl: >                     # Smallest version that works (TinyClaw)
  Describe the smallest implementation that actually works.

definition_of_done:                 # Concrete, measurable outcomes
  - First verifiable outcome
  - Second verifiable outcome

# REQUIRED: Planning metadata
effort: M                          # S (hours) | M (days) | L (weeks)
build_recipe: builder_safe         # planner_only | builder_safe | operator_blocked
  # planner_only = research/ideation only, no code execution
  # builder_safe = code generation allowed, human review required
  # operator_blocked = never auto-execute, human must run

# REQUIRED: Priority
priority: now                       # now | next | someday

# OPTIONAL: Dependencies
dependencies:                       # Required components or prerequisites
  - BI-002
  - External: Some requirement

# OPTIONAL: Risk assessment
risks: >                           # Security, complexity, or distraction risks
  What could go wrong?

mitigations: >                      # How to reduce risks
  How to reduce risks?

# OPTIONAL: Tags for filtering
tags:                              # Free-form tags
  - feature
  - security
  - phase-1
