"""Staffing ``run`` selection and subprocess dispatch (P1-5a).

Implements the selection-plus-dispatch foundation of the ``run`` command
(D209 ruling 4 via ``docs/staffing/phase1-contracts.md`` §``run``):

* **Selection.** Role/class selection (always required; ``--route`` is
  optional on top, per the Chief's corrected D209 contract in
  ``docs/staffing/chief-answers-p1-1.md``), over
  exactly the ``catalog explain`` path (:func:`evaluate_eligibility` over
  the committed catalog, an availability snapshot, dated terms, and
  marginal pricing). An explicit route must be active and currently
  eligible under the same role/class path; an excluded explicit route is
  a refusal (exit 3) carrying the
  exact explain reason, and nothing is launched. Role/class selection
  takes the first eligible route in ``catalog explain --json``
  marginal-price order and preserves the selection basis, reason, explain
  reference, and every excluded route id/reason — explain evidence only,
  never a new selection judgment (D206).
* **Dispatch.** The selected route's harness provider ``build_command``
  argv is substituted with the packet prompt and run exactly once through
  the repository's watchdog/subprocess boundary
  (:func:`run_supervised_dispatch` below), with ``cwd`` set to the
  workdir and no shell interpolation anywhere. Pi runs its JSON event
  mode and captures usage through the accepted P1-4a parser; Codex forces
  ``json_flag: --json`` (the P1-4b governed capture note) and parses the
  JSONL receipt; Claude reuses the committed governed capture
  (``--output-format stream-json``) and parses the result event through
  :func:`capture_claude_usage`.
  Governed dispatch (P1-8) also grants implementation routes the minimum
  noninteractive editing capability: Pi receives an explicit bounded
  editing tool allowlist (no ``bash``), Codex receives the exec-level
  writable-workspace sandbox and git-repo-check skip flags, and Claude
  receives the documented noninteractive permission flags
  (``--permission-mode acceptEdits --permission-prompts none``) so scoped
  edits are accepted without an interactive host; no dangerous bypass
  flag is ever emitted on any harness.
  Every other wired harness runs the same boundary and records
  ``usage.basis: unavailable`` with a specific reason — no parser ever
  invents tokens.

P1-5b2 completes the boundary: after the one worker and optional oracle,
``run`` assembles one v2 attempt record, calculates list/marginal cost only
from known counters and the selected dated price, validates it through the
committed ledger API, appends it once, and prints the same record compactly.
``run`` never escalates; parent and escalation-reason are only recorded as a
paired link supplied by its supervisor.

P1-4 ruling 3 (``docs/staffing/chief-answers-p1-4.md``, Astra final-review
finding 5) adds the optional caller attestation ``--supervisor-route <route
id>``: the caller attests its own route. The attested id is validated as a
governed *identity* — it must name a known catalog route that is active and
currently usable (every governed exclusion that is not role/class policy
still refuses, exit 3, before anything is launched) — but the worker's
role/class capability policy is never imposed on the supervisor: a
role-scoped or otherwise class-ineligible model may still attest, because
attesting one's identity is not performing the worker's task. The accepted
supervisor-route object (identity tuple plus observed provider) is recorded
only when the caller supplies the attestation. When the attested dispatch
succeeds, the oracle passes, and every existing evidence gate holds,
``verified_success`` is true; otherwise the record carries exactly one
``verified_success_reason`` from the closed P1-4 vocabulary
(:data:`VERIFIED_SUCCESS_REASON_UNATTESTED` when unattested, otherwise the
first blocking gap in a fixed documented order) — never a claimed success.

Chief round 15 packet D's ``--author-route`` (Astra final-review finding 4)
is forwarded to the same ``catalog explain`` eligibility path so ``run``
can enforce reviewer independence: for a review/judge class the author
route and every same-family candidate are excluded with the reason
``independence`` exactly as ``catalog explain --author-route`` reports, an
unknown author route fails closed, and an excluded explicit route is a
refusal carrying the exact explain reason. Without ``--author-route``
independence is not evaluated, exactly as in explain.

Astra final-review finding 6 also governs the failure boundary: all
caller-controlled record metadata (``--parent``/``--escalation-reason``
pair and pattern, ``attempt_id``) is validated before anything is launched
(:func:`validate_attempt_metadata`), and when the optional oracle cannot be
launched or set up *after* the worker completed, the completed worker is
never dropped: exactly one schema-valid attempt is persisted preserving the
worker evidence and the oracle failure (truthful verdict, failure class,
and ``verified_success``), then the CLI returns its governed failure.

    path — :func:`evaluate_eligibility` with the committed catalog, the
    supplied availability snapshot, dated terms at ``at_date``, and
    marginal pricing. No other checks, probabilities, or ladders apply.

    Args:
        catalog: The loaded staffing catalog (read-only).
        availability: An already-normalised availability snapshot.
        role: Class role (from the ``--class`` string; ``run`` has no
            separate role flag in explicit mode).
        oracle_type: Class oracle type.
        size_band: Class size band.
        language: Class language.
        domain_tags: Class domain-tag set.
        class_key: The canonical five-segment class string; must equal the
            canonical rendering of the structured fields (enforced by the
            eligibility evaluation).
        at_date: Date for the dated-terms check (ISO string or date).
        route_id: Explicit ``--route`` selection. The route must exist and
            be currently eligible; otherwise :class:`RunSelectionError`
            with exit code 3 and the exact explain reason.
        instance_id: Optional explicit ``--instance`` pin. When supplied,
            pins a specific channel instance for the selected route. The
            instance must exist, be enabled, and be eligible (otherwise
            :class:`RunSelectionError` with exit code 3). When omitted, the
            first eligible instance in ``instance_headrooms`` is selected,
            or ``None`` for channels without instances or with none eligible.
        supervisor_route_id: Optional ``--supervisor-route`` attestation
            (P1-4 ruling 3): the caller attests its own route. The id must
            name a known, active, currently usable catalog route — every
            governed exclusion that is not role/class policy still refuses
            (exit 3, nothing launched) — but the worker's role/class
            capability policy is never imposed on the supervisor identity
            (Astra final-review finding 5). When resolved, the accepted
            supervisor-route object is carried on the outcome.
        author_route_id: Optional author route id, forwarded to the
            eligibility evaluation (review/judge independence). The CLI
            forwards ``--author-route``; without it independence is not
            evaluated, exactly as in ``catalog explain``, and an unknown
            author id fails closed.
        openrouter_snapshot_path: Injectable pinned OpenRouter snapshot
            path (defaults to the committed pinned file).
        rate_table_path: Injectable agent-orch rate-table path.

    Returns:
        The :class:`SelectionOutcome` for the single selected route, with
        the selection basis, reason, explain reference, and every excluded
        route id/reason preserved from the same evaluation.

    Raises:
        RunSelectionError: When the class arguments are invalid, the
            explicit route id matches no catalog route, the explicit route
            is not currently eligible, no route is eligible for

    The committed price API exposes the dated replacement input/output rates,

    the selected dated terms source.

    When cached tokens are reported:
    * If cached input is a subset of input (Codex), uncached input is separated
      (``input_tokens - cached_input_tokens``). An invalid relationship where
      cached input exceeds input fails closed as unavailable cost.
    * If cached input is reported separately (Pi and other non-subset harnesses),
      ``input_tokens`` is already uncached input and cached tokens are added at
      the cache rate.
    * Cache rates from authoritative P0-4 sources are applied when cached
      tokens are present. If cached tokens are nonzero but cache price evidence
      is unavailable for the model, cost fails closed as unavailable.
    * Null/absent cached tokens do not bill cache and do not fabricate zeros,
      except for harnesses whose receipt separates cache reads from input; for
      those harnesses an absent split is incomplete billing evidence.
    * OpenCode reports reasoning separately from ordinary output. Both are
      billed at the selected output-token rate only when the separate reasoning
      counter is authoritative; no reasoning count or price is invented.
    * Agy and OpenCode cache-write counters are preserved when captured. A
      nonzero write count has no selected dated price in the P0-4 API, so cost
      fails closed rather than dropping the component.

    Complete-billing-evidence gates (Astra final review finding 1):
    * The selected dated price terms price exactly the selected route's
      model. A usage aggregate that spans multiple models (the Claude
      ``modelUsage`` ids surfaced as ``aggregate_models``) cannot be priced
      at that single rate and fails closed as unavailable, as does a
      single-model aggregate for a model other than the priced route model.
    * For harnesses whose authoritative ``total_tokens`` includes the
      cache-read and cache-write components (Pi, OMP, Claude), cost exists
      only when the total is known and every token it counts is
      representable as billing evidence: an unknown total could hide
      cache-write tokens, and a positive remainder over the represented
      input/output/cache-read components is exactly the unrepresentable
      cache-write charge. Either gap fails closed as unavailable cost
      rather than billing a subset of the receipt.
    * A valid JSON token integer has no size bound (finding 2). When the
      known tokens exceed the representable float cost range, the
      multiplication by float prices would raise ``OverflowError`` after
      the worker has completed, so cost fails closed as unavailable while
      the truthful usage and the completed attempt are preserved.

            invented when the caller records no supervisor identity.
        attempt_id: Optional caller-supplied id; generated when absent.
        captured_at: Optional aware UTC capture timestamp, primarily for tests.
        class_derivation: Optional validated packet-derivation evidence. Only
            its override records are preserved in provenance; it never selects
            or ranks a route.
        artifacts_dir: Optional explicit root directory for attempt artifacts.

    Args:

        workdir: Optional child working directory; must exist.
        timeout_seconds: Wall-clock ceiling in seconds; ``None`` uses the

        stall_minutes: Silence minutes before a stall is flagged.
        progress_minutes: Minutes without watch-dir change before kill.
        stall_action: Action on stall ("kill" or "warn").
        watch_dirs: Directories to monitor for file activity.
        popen: Injected process spawner (tests).
        clock: Injected monotonic clock (tests).
        sleep: Injected sleep callable (tests).
        poll_seconds: Watchdog polling cadence.
        stderr: Stream for watchdog warnings (defaults to ``sys.stderr``).
        extra_env: Optional environment variables to merge into the child
            environment.

    Returns:
        The :class:`DispatchOutcome` with the final argv, captured
