"""Pure route-eligibility evaluation over the staffing catalog (P0-5).

Deterministic, typed evaluation returning one :class:`EligibilityRow` per
catalog route, in catalog order (never sorted or ranked here). Applied
checks, each with a named reason string:

* route status — ``unpriced``/``retired`` routes are excluded (chief round
  6: unpriced exact ids stay in the catalog and are excluded by
  eligibility, not absent);
* channel ``harness_lock`` — a route whose harness is not in the
  channel's committed lock list is excluded; an empty lock list means no
  committed mapping, so no constraint is invented;
* policy ``never_automatic`` (D152/D187/D204) — a matched model is never
  eligible for automatic selection;
* policy ``role_scoped`` (D188) — the class role maps to a governance
  class solely for this D188 check (``impl`` -> ``coding``;
  ``plan``/``review``/``judge``/``prose`` -> ``planning_review``),
  never a preference. The committed ``policy.role_class`` rows (D189)
  govern stage-role names and are not re-derived here;
* role floors — not applied: the committed catalog carries ``role_floors``
  records (Chief round 15, D86/D87), but floors are recorded data only —
  they are not enforced in Phase 0 because the current route tiers lack
  authority (no T1-T4 tier is assigned to any current route/model). No
  floor check runs here, so no floor exclusion reason is ever emitted and
  recorded floors change no route's eligibility;
* subscription headroom veto (``availability.py``) — evaluated per
  enabled instance: an enabled instance whose headroom is ``exhausted``,
  ``likely_exhausted``, or ``unknown`` is vetoed. Metered and local channels
  carry no committed quota records and are never vetoed for their absence;
* subscription reserve (D216) — evaluated per enabled instance: an enabled
  instance whose ``remaining_fraction`` in any binding window is at or below
  its configured ``reserve_fraction`` (default 0.10; Anthropic and Gemini
  explicitly 0.10) is excluded with the reason
  ``reserve: N% kept in the tank (D216)``. The reserve is a policy floor,
  distinct from the availability reader's ``likely_exhausted`` fail-safe;
  both checks run and either can independently exclude an instance.
  A route is vetoed by health/reserve only when every enabled instance is
  vetoed (or no enabled instance exists);
* model-scoped bucket veto (``availability.MODEL_SCOPED_BUCKETS``) — some
  buckets ``ai-subs`` reports meter one model family inside a channel rather
  than the channel as a whole (``Claude Fable — weekly`` beside ``Current
  session`` and ``All models — weekly``). The availability reader keeps such
  a bucket out of the channel- and instance-wide reduction, and this check
  applies it per route: only routes whose ``model`` starts with the bucket's
  mapped family token are constrained. The same two vetoes used for instance
  headroom are applied (the health veto and the reserve floor), each naming
  the bucket it came from — ``model bucket '<name>' exhausted`` and
  ``model bucket '<name>' reserve: N% kept in the tank (D216)``. A model
  sub-limit therefore stops gating sibling models while still gating its own;
* dated terms at the requested date and the badge marginal multiplier —
  each route is priced at the badge derived from its own channel's record
  in the availability snapshot (the limiting bucket's raw status badge);
  a channel with no recorded badge (missing record, metered/local, or a
  snapshot failure status) fails closed to the committed ``NO DATA``
  badge, whose configured multiplier is 1.0. A pricing failure excludes
  the route with a named reason.
* author-route independence (Chief round 15, packet D) — applied only when
  an author route id is supplied *and* the role is ``review`` or
  ``judge``: the author route itself and every candidate whose model
  family equals the author's are excluded with the reason
  ``independence``. The family is the route's ``family`` attribute when
  it carries a nonempty one, else the deterministic model-vendor-prefix
  fallback (namespaced model id: namespace before ``/``; unnamespaced:
  leading token before the first ``-``). Independence is an
  author/candidate comparison only, never a class-to-model preference
  (D206). Without an author route id no ``independence`` reason is ever
  emitted; for roles other than review/judge the check is not applicable
  and no reason is added. An unknown author route id fails closed with a
  named :class:`StaffingEligibilityError`.

D206 (verbatim, phase0-contracts.md §Class-metadata prohibition):
"Class metadata MUST NOT map directly to a preferred model or route. It
may only: 1. join production attempts to comparable benchmark evidence;
and 2. determine whether an unevidenced cheap trial is permitted."
Accordingly the structured class fields and their canonical key are
validated against the committed classes value sets, and the role maps to
a governance class solely for D188 role-scoped eligibility. The cheap-
trial rule is *not* applied here and no class ever adds eligibility.

No probability, ladder, model choice, or ranking lives in this module
(Phase 2 owns those).

            set; recorded for the canonical key only — the cheap-trial rule
            is deliberately *not* applied here).
        size_band: Class size band (validated; canonical key only).
        language: Class language (validated; canonical key only).
        domain_tags: Class domain-tag set (validated; canonical key only).
        class_key: Optional canonical class-key string; when given it must
            equal :func:`canonical_class_key` of the structured fields or
            :class:`StaffingEligibilityError` is raised.
        author_route_id: Optional author route id (Chief round 15, packet
            D). Only for the ``review``/``judge`` roles: the author route
            itself and every candidate whose model family equals the
            author's (see :func:`resolve_route_family`) are excluded with
            the reason ``independence`` — an author/candidate comparison
            only, never a class-to-model preference (D206). For other
            roles the check is not applicable and no reason is added.
            An unknown id fails closed with a named
            :class:`StaffingEligibilityError`.
        availability: An already-normalised
            :class:`~lee_llm_router.availability.AvailabilitySnapshot`.
            Subscription channels evaluate headroom and reserve per enabled
            instance; a route is vetoed only when every enabled instance is
            vetoed (or no enabled instance exists). Metered and local channels
            are never vetoed for missing quota records. Model-scoped buckets
            (``model_scope``) are applied per route instead, only to routes
            whose model starts with the bucket's family token.
        at_date: Requested date (ISO string or :class:`datetime.date`) for
            the dated-terms check.
        openrouter_snapshot_path: Injectable pinned OpenRouter snapshot path
            (defaults to the committed pinned file).
        rate_table_path: Injectable agent-orch rate-table path (defaults to
            the committed default).

    Returns:
        One :class:`EligibilityRow` per catalog route, in catalog order.
        Each route's marginal price is its replacement price times the
        configured multiplier of the badge recorded for *its own channel*
        in ``availability`` (the limiting bucket's raw status badge); a
        channel with no recorded badge — missing record, metered/local
        channel, or a snapshot failure status — fails closed to the
        committed ``NO DATA`` badge (multiplier 1.0).
        ``eligible`` is exactly ``not reasons``; no ranking, sorting,
        probability, or choice is applied.

    Raises:
        StaffingEligibilityError: When a class field is outside the
            committed value sets or ``class_key`` mismatches the structured
            arguments, when ``at_date`` is not an ISO date, or when
            ``author_route_id`` is supplied but matches no catalog
            route_id.
