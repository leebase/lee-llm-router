"""Pure route-eligibility evaluation over the staffing catalog (P0-5).

Deterministic, typed evaluation returning one :class:`EligibilityRow` per
catalog route, in catalog order (never sorted or ranked here). Applied
checks, each with a named reason string:

* route status — ``unpriced``/``retired`` routes are excluded (chief round
  6: unpriced exact ids stay in the catalog and are excluded by
  eligibility, not absent);
* channel ``harness_lock`` — a route whose harness is not in the
  channel's committed lock list is excluded; an empty lock list means no
  committed mapping, so no constraint is invented;
* policy ``never_automatic`` (D152/D187/D204) — a matched model is never
  eligible for automatic selection;
* policy ``role_scoped`` (D188) — the class role maps to a governance
  class solely for this D188 check (``impl`` -> ``coding``;
  ``plan``/``review``/``judge``/``prose`` -> ``planning_review``),
  never a preference. The committed ``policy.role_class`` rows (D189)
  govern stage-role names and are not re-derived here;
* role floors — not applied: the committed catalog carries ``role_floors``
  records (Chief round 15, D86/D87), but floors are recorded data only —
  they are not enforced in Phase 0 because the current route tiers lack
  authority (no T1-T4 tier is assigned to any current route/model). No
  floor check runs here, so no floor exclusion reason is ever emitted and
  recorded floors change no route's eligibility;
* subscription headroom veto (``availability.py``) — evaluated per
  enabled instance: an enabled instance whose headroom is ``exhausted``,
  ``likely_exhausted``, or ``unknown`` is vetoed. Metered and local channels
  carry no committed quota records and are never vetoed for their absence;
* subscription reserve (D216/D334) — evaluated per enabled instance and
  **per channel-wide bucket**: each bucket's D334 *coverage* (its own remaining
  capacity divided by the fraction of *its own* window still to run) is
  computed from that same bucket's ``remaining_fraction``,
  ``resets_in_hours`` and ``window_hours`` — one bucket's capacity is never
  read next to another bucket's clock. The headroom's aggregate
  ``remaining_fraction`` is the smallest fraction across the channel-wide
  buckets while ``limiting_bucket`` names the worst-*health* bucket; those two
  reductions need not be the same bucket, so neither is used to pair a
  fraction with a window here. A bucket whose own coverage is below ``0.5``
  reserves the instance, with the reason ``bucket '<name>' reserve: coverage C
  < 0.50 (D334)`` naming the bucket. When the snapshot cannot supply a
  bucket's inputs — an absent/zero/negative/non-finite ``window_hours`` or an
  absent/negative/non-finite ``hours_to_reset`` — that bucket's coverage is not
  computable and the plain D216 floor applies instead: its
  ``remaining_fraction`` at or below the configured ``reserve_fraction``
  (default 0.10) reserves the instance with ``bucket '<name>' reserve: N% kept
  in the tank (D216)``. A bucket's coverage at or above ``1.0`` is *expiring
  surplus*: usable, and surfaced on the row via ``expiring_surplus`` for a
  later ranking packet — never consumed here. An instance reserved by any
  bucket never also reports surplus. The reserve is a policy floor, distinct
  from the availability reader's ``likely_exhausted`` fail-safe; both checks
  run and either can independently exclude an instance.
  A route is vetoed by health/reserve only when every enabled instance is
  vetoed (or no enabled instance exists);
* model-scoped bucket veto (``availability.MODEL_SCOPED_BUCKETS``) — some
  buckets ``ai-subs`` reports meter one model family inside a channel rather
  than the channel as a whole (``Claude Fable — weekly`` beside ``Current
  session`` and ``All models — weekly``). The availability reader keeps such
  a bucket out of the channel- and instance-wide reduction, and this check
  applies it per route: only routes whose ``model`` starts with the bucket's
  mapped family token are constrained. The same two vetoes used for instance
  headroom are applied (the health veto and the D334 coverage reserve), each
  naming the bucket it came from — ``model bucket '<name>' exhausted`` and
  ``model bucket '<name>' reserve: coverage C < 0.50 (D334)`` (the plain
  ``reserve: N% kept in the tank (D216)`` form when coverage is not
  computable). A model sub-limit therefore stops gating sibling models while
  still gating its own;
* dated terms at the requested date and the badge marginal multiplier —
  each route is priced at the badge derived from its own channel's record
  in the availability snapshot (the limiting bucket's raw status badge);
  a channel with no recorded badge (missing record, metered/local, or a
  snapshot failure status) fails closed to the committed ``NO DATA``
  badge, whose configured multiplier is 1.0. A pricing failure excludes
  the route with a named reason.
* author-route independence (Chief round 15, packet D) — applied only when
  an author route id is supplied *and* the role is ``review`` or
  ``judge``: the author route itself is always excluded. Same-family
  candidates are excluded with ``independence`` for judge and by default
  for review. A review rule explicitly declaring
  ``prefer_different_family: false`` permits a different route in the
  same family and discloses that limitation in its reasons. The family is
  the route's ``family`` attribute when
  it carries a nonempty one, else the deterministic model-vendor-prefix
  fallback (namespaced model id: namespace before ``/``; unnamespaced:
  leading token before the first ``-``). Independence is an
  author/candidate comparison only, never a class-to-model preference
  (D206). Without an author route id no ``independence`` reason is ever
  emitted; for roles other than review/judge the check is not applicable
  and no reason is added. An unknown author route id fails closed with a
  named :class:`StaffingEligibilityError`.

D206 (verbatim, phase0-contracts.md §Class-metadata prohibition):
"Class metadata MUST NOT map directly to a preferred model or route. It
may only: 1. join production attempts to comparable benchmark evidence;
and 2. determine whether an unevidenced cheap trial is permitted."
Accordingly the structured class fields and their canonical key are
validated against the committed classes value sets, and the role maps to
a governance class solely for D188 role-scoped eligibility. The cheap-
trial rule is *not* applied here and no class ever adds eligibility.

No probability, ladder, model choice, or ranking lives in this module
(Phase 2 owns those).

        oracle_type: Class oracle type (validated against the classes value

            :class:`StaffingEligibilityError` is raised.
        author_route_id: Optional author route id (Chief round 15, packet
            D). Only for ``review``/``judge``: the author route itself is

            Subscription channels evaluate headroom and reserve per enabled

            are never vetoed for missing quota records. Model-scoped buckets
            (``model_scope``) are applied per route instead, only to routes
            whose model starts with the bucket's family token.
        at_date: Requested date (ISO string or :class:`datetime.date`) for
            the dated-terms check.
        openrouter_snapshot_path: Injectable pinned OpenRouter snapshot path

        One :class:`EligibilityRow` per catalog route, in catalog order.
        Each route's marginal price is its replacement price times the

        in ``availability`` (the limiting bucket's raw status badge); a
        channel with no recorded badge — missing record, metered/local
        channel, or a snapshot failure status — fails closed to the
        committed ``NO DATA`` badge (multiplier 1.0).
        ``eligible`` is true when there are no exclusion reasons;
